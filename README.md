## About V0.5

RailwayAnalyse by PVCDoric is the prototype version of a customisable tool which gets information about railways from JSON files to display the information in a presentable user-centred manner. Version 0.5 includes sample information from LACMTA's Metro Rail: an urban railway in Los Angeles. Future versions will include both line and station information
